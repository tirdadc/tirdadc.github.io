I switched to [Atom](https://atom.io/) as my main editor about a year ago. While its memory footprint is substantially bigger than [Chocolat](https://chocolatapp.com/)'s, it's also much richer in terms of features and 3rd party support without some of the issues that made me leave [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for that in the first place.

Here's a selection of the more interesting 3rd party packages that I currently use.

#### Gadgets

[Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) - A preview of the full source code.
